# SQL-LAB

## Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate the application of SQL queries with filters to enhance the organization's system security. By using operators such as AND, OR, NOT, and LIKE, the queries help identify potential security incidents, optimize employee machine updates, and investigate suspicious login attempts. This process contributes to the integrity and protection of the company's data, ensuring that only relevant information is accessed and analyzed efficiently.

### Skills Learned

- Data filtering: By using specific operators I can search for data according to my needs.
- IT Asset Management: ​​Identify employee devices for security updates.
- Access and Authentication Monitoring: Analysis of login attempts to detect unauthorized access.
- Data-Driven Decision Making: Using information obtained through consultations for corrective actions.
- Process Optimization – Use of filters to reduce analysis time and make investigation more efficient.

## Project Description

My organization is working to make its system more secure. It is my job to ensure that the system is secure, investigate all potential security issues, and update employee computers as needed. The following steps provide examples of how I used SQL with filters to perform security-related tasks.

## Steps

### Recover Failed Login Attempts After Business Hours

There was a potential security incident that occurred after business hours (after 6:00 PM). All failed login attempts after business hours need to be investigated.

The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter failed login attempts that occurred after business hours.
